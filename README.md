This repository is dedicated to learning the Kotlin programming language through the course provided by Instructor KasÄ±m Adalan on Udemy. Throughout the course, I am storing the code I write here. Below are the contents of the code:

- Arrays
- Arrays with loops
- Usage of Break and Continue
- Comparison operators
- Console input-output operations
